## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: First-Launch Example Data Prompt

The app MUST ask the user, the **first time it is opened on a device**,
whether to load the bundled sample routine (see "Generate Example Data" in
the data-portability spec). Whether the user accepts or declines, the app
MUST remember locally on the device that the user has been asked, so the
prompt is shown **at most once** per device. This "already asked" flag is
**device-local** (like the font-size preference) and MUST NOT be part of the
exported/imported data backup. Accepting MUST run the same sample-data
generation used by "Gerar exemplo" in Settings. Declining MUST leave the app
without any generated data; the user can still generate the sample later from
Settings. A device that **already has registered data** the first time this
capability runs (e.g. an existing installation upgrading to a build that
includes this feature) MUST be treated as already-asked and MUST NOT be
prompted retroactively.

#### Scenario: First open offers the sample data
- GIVEN the app is opened for the first time on a device (no registered data, never asked before)
- WHEN the app finishes loading
- THEN the user is asked whether to load the sample exercises and training days

#### Scenario: Accepting loads the sample routine
- GIVEN the first-launch prompt is shown
- WHEN the user accepts
- THEN the bundled example routine is generated (the same result as tapping "Gerar exemplo" in Settings)
- AND the generated categories, exercises, days, gym, and weights are visible on Home

#### Scenario: Declining starts empty
- GIVEN the first-launch prompt is shown
- WHEN the user declines (or dismisses the prompt)
- THEN no data is created
- AND the user can still generate the sample later from Settings → Backup → "Gerar exemplo"

#### Scenario: Prompt shown only once per device
- GIVEN the user has already been asked (accepted or declined) on this device
- WHEN the app is opened again
- THEN the first-launch prompt does not reappear

#### Scenario: Existing installs are not retroactively prompted
- GIVEN a device already has registered data (e.g. gyms or exercises) from before this capability existed
- WHEN the app is opened on a build that includes this capability for the first time
- THEN the device is treated as already-asked and the first-launch prompt is not shown
